# NMS API
 
API Overview

The NMS API (.Net Message Service API) provides a standard .NET interface to Messaging Systems. There are multiple implementations for different providers (including MSMQ). The NMS API allows you to build .NET applications in C#, VB, or any other .NET language, using a single API to connect to multiple different providers using a JMS style API.

NMS API currently supports all of the features of JMS in a simple pure C# API and implementation apart from XA
