MassTransit is a lightweight service bus for building distributed .NET applications. The main goal is to provide a consistent, .NET friendly abstraction over the message transport (whether it is RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, etc.). To meet this goal, MassTransit brings a lot of the application-specific logic closer to the developer in an easy to configure and understand manner.
