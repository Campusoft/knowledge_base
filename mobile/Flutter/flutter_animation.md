# Hero animations

Hero animations are implemented using two Hero widgets: one describing the widget in the source route, and another describing the widget in the destination route.

The Hero class in Flutter is a widget that marks its child for the hero animations.

## SliverAppBar 

SliverAppBar is a Material Design widget in flutter which gives scrollable or collapsible app-bar. 

A sliver is a portion of a scrollable area that you can define to behave in a special way. You can use slivers to achieve custom scrolling effects, such as elastic scrolling.
