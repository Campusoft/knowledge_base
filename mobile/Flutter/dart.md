# Dart



# types

The Dart language has special support for the following:

- Numbers (int, double)
- Strings (String)
- Booleans (bool)
- Lists (List, also known as arrays)
- Sets (Set)
- Maps (Map)
- Runes (Runes; often replaced by the characters API)
- Symbols (Symbol)
- The value null (Null)


Dart supports generic types, like List<int> (a list of integers) or List<Object> (a list of objects of any type).

## Maps

In general, a map is an object that associates keys and values. Both keys and values can be any type of object. 

```


var gifts = Map<String, String>();
gifts['first'] = 'partridge';
gifts['second'] = 'turtledoves';
gifts['fifth'] = 'golden rings';

var nobleGases = Map<int, String>();
nobleGases[2] = 'helium';
nobleGases[10] = 'neon';
nobleGases[18] = 'argon';

```
