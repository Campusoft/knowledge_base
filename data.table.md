The deltaRowDataMode is designed to allow ag-Grid work with immutable stores such as Redux. In an immutable store, a new list of rowData is created if any row within it is added, removed or updated. If using React and Redux, consider setting deltaRowDataMode=true and bind your Redux managed data to the rowData property.
You can also use this technique in a non-Redux or immutable store based application (which is the case in the examples on this page). As long as you understand what is happening, if it fits your applications needs, then use it.
