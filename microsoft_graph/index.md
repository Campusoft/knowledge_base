Microsoft Graph
-------------------


Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. Use the wealth of data in Microsoft Graph to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with millions of users.

Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. 


Call a REST API method

```
{HTTP method} https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{resource}?{query-parameters}
```

The components of a request include:

- {HTTP method} - The HTTP method used on the request to Microsoft Graph.
- {version} - The version of the Microsoft Graph API your application is using.
- {resource} - The resource in Microsoft Graph that you're referencing.
- {query-parameters} - Optional OData query options or REST method parameters that customize the response.



Data is retrieved from Microsoft Graph through a REST API or using one of the various native SDKs provided by Microsoft.
