# refresh

Troubleshoot refresh scenarios
- Scheduled refresh time-out. Scheduled refresh for imported datasets time out after two hours. This time-out is increased to five hours for datasets in Premium workspaces. If you encounter this limit, consider reducing the size or complexity of your dataset, or consider refactoring the large dataset into multiple smaller datasets.
