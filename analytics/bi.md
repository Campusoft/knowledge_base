## Superset Architecture

In distributed mode superset spread the queries(only it do it for sql_lab, not for dashboards and explore_json) between its celery workers. Superset can use RabbitMQ or Redis for distributing the tasks and it uses Redis for caching queries.

Apache superset is built entirely on top of python; it uses flask app builder internally.
It supports python version > 3.6

Superset is also cloud-native in the sense that it is flexible and lets you choose the:

- web server (Gunicorn, Nginx, Apache), (can run multiple instances). The web server is a flask python app, using sqlalchemy ORM to connect to any database.
- metadata database engine (MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB, etc),
- message queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc),
- results backend (S3, Redis, Memcached, etc),
- caching layer (Memcached, Redis, etc)

## Dashboard & Slices

Dashboard is nothing but a user interface that allows you to examine various graphs and data. So, each section inside the Dashboard is called Slice. Slices can be in the form of data, text, graph, or anything that shares insightsâ€“for example, the total number of users who bought a product in a specific city.
