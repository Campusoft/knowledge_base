# Cassandra

It implements a Columnar Storage Architecture and can handle large volumes of data distributed across multiple Apache Cassandra nodes.

Another advantage of using Apache Cassandra is its query language. It uses Cassandra Query Language (CQL) to access data which has a syntax that is very similar to Structured Query Language (SQL). Due to its similarity with SQL, most developers are easily able to switch to Apache Cassandra

# Availability

Apache Cassandra on the other hand has multiple Master Nodes inside a cluster. This means that if one of the Master Nodes goes down, there is no downtime since other active Master Nodes can handle the incoming requests. Because of this architecture, Apache Cassandra can guarantee 100% availability for writes.
