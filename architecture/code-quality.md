Cobertura de pruebas - code coverage

To get an understanding of code coverage, we have to talk about testing code. A test runs a piece of code and ensures that the system produces the expected behavior given some input. Some tests check to see if a database updates properly, others will make sure a UI component is available. But testing is so important because bugs are everywhere. Finding and fixing issues in code can take days of an engineerâ€™s time. A bad deployment can cost a company thousands to millions of dollars before it can be fixed. Bugs can leave holes for malicious users to take advantage of vulnerable systems. As a user, you have undoubtedly run into a few software bugs in your own life. 

Code coverage is a testing technique that informs what code is tested and what is not tested. It is often represented as a percentage of the number of lines of code that are tested versus the entire codebase.
