## ETag

El encabezado de respuesta de HTTP ETag es un identificador para una versión específica de un recurso. 


An ETag or an "entity-tag" is simply a string; which represents some "version" of the data that the client possesses, and the client conveys this "version" to the server to check whether any new "version" of it is already created at the server end. When there is no new "version" of the resource possessed by the client, the server replies back saying resource is "304 Not Modified". If there is a new "version" available at the server end, the server replies back with the new resource to the client along "200 OK" response and a new ETag which represents this new "version" of the string for the client to convey from then onwards.
