# Lerna


Lerna is a monorepo manager for JavaScript projects. It helps you take a large codebase and split it into independently deployable packages. Lerna handles every step in the release process â€” from downloading dependencies, and linking packages together, to testing and publishing updated packages to the NPM registry.
