# Versiones

ECMAScript is the standard name for JavaScript.

ES7  / ES.Next  / (ES2017)

ECMAScript 2016: The expected 7th edition of ECMAScript. This is scheduled to be released next summer. The details of what the spec will contain have not been finalized yet

Async/await (ES2017).

Currently there are several proposals for new features or syntax to be added to JavaScript. These include decorators, async-await, and static class properties. These are often refered to as ES7, ES2016, or ES.Next features, but should realistically be called proposals or possibilities, since the ECMAScript 2016 specification hasn’t been written yet, and might include all or none of those features. TC39 divides proposals into 4 stages. You can see the current state of various proposals on the TC39 Github repo.
