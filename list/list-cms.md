## Ghost

Architecture

Ghost is structured as a modern, decoupled web application with a sensible service-based architecture


Data & Storage

Ghost ships with the Bookshelf.js ORM layer by default allowing for a range of databases to be used. Currently SQLite3 is the supported default in development while MySQL is recommended for production. Other databases are available, and compatible, but not supported by the core team.

Ghost Core

At its heart, Ghost is a RESTful JSON API — designed to create, manage and retrieve publication content with ease.

Ghost’s API is split by function into two parts: Content and Admin. Each has its own authentication methods, structure and extensive tooling so that common publication usecases are solved with minimal effort.

Webhooks

Notify an external service when content has changed or been updated by calling a configured HTTP endpoint. This makes it a breeze to do things like trigger a rebuild in a static site generator, or notify Slack that something happened.

Static Site Generators

Thanks to its decoupled architecture Ghost is also compatible with just about any of the front-end frameworks or static site generators which have become increasingly popular thanks to being fun to work with, extremely fast, and more and more powerful as the JAMstack grows in maturity. So it works with the tools you already use.

This very documentation site is running on a Gatsby.js front-end, connected to both Ghost and GitHub as content sources, hosted statically on Netlify with dynamic serverless functions powered by AWS Lambda (like the feedback form at the bottom of this page). It’s a brave new world!
