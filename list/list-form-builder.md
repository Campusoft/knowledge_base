With Webiny you can build:

    Websites
    Applications
    GraphQL APIs
    Microservices

What Webiny is not, and what you can't use Webiny for:

    Webiny is not a library that you can embed in other applications. Webiny is a standalone application. You can render Page Builder pages and Form Builder forms in 3rd party React apps. You can't embed the editors inside 3rd party apps.
    At the moment you can't run Webiny on a different cloud provider, besides AWS. It you wish to add support for another cloud provider, please see this issue.
