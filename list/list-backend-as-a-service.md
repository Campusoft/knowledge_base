# Listado Backend as a Service (BaaS)

BaaS started to gain momentum as well. BaaS systems are those that provide infrastructure software services, and these include storage as a service, database as a service, messaging, and notifications as a service. With serverless architecture, applications usually use a combination of BaaS services, which are often provided by the vendor cloud echo system such as Google's Firebase and Amazon DynamoDB. Other third-party BaaS services may include authentication services (like Auth0, AWS Cognito, and Azure Active Directory).

## Supabase

Supabase is a combination of open source tools. Weâ€™re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Supabase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.
