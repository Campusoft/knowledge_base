# Node Framework

# Nest

Nest is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Under the hood, Nest makes use of Express, but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, like e.g. Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.


A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side applications on top of TypeScript & JavaScript (ES6, ES7, ES8) 

# Fastify

Fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js

Core features

These are the main features and principles on which fastify has been built:

-   Highly performant: as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 30 thousand requests per second.
-   Extensible: Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins and decorators.
-   Schema based: even if it is not mandatory we recommend to use JSON Schema to validate your routes and serialize your outputs, internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant function.
-   Logging: logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best logger to almost remove this cost, Pino!
-   Developer friendly: the framework is built to be very expressive and to help developers in their daily use, without sacrificing performance and security.
-   TypeScript ready: we work hard to maintain a TypeScript type declaration file so we can support the growing TypeScript community.
