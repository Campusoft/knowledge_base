# SharePoint Framework

The SharePoint Framework works for SharePoint Online and soon also for on-premises (SharePoint 2016 Feature Pack 2). 



# Add-ins for SharePoint


# Build for Microsoft Teams using SharePoint Framework

When you build Teams tabs and personal apps using SharePoint Framework, your solutions are automatically hosted for you in SharePoint. You donâ€™t need any additional resources in Microsoft Azure. This significantly simplifies the deployment process and operations and lowers the overall cost of your solution.


# Power Apps

Power Apps also lets you easily customize the form for a SharePoint list. For example, with custom forms, you can:

    Show or hide certain fields.
    Reorganize those fields.
    Change the layout of a form.
    Add formatted text and graphics.
