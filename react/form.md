# React Hook Form

React Hook Form is a performant and easy-to-use library that takes advantage of React Hooks to build forms. It works by registering components to a React hook using a provided register method, and provides a handleSubmit method that validates all form data before calling the onSubmit callback that you provide.

Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation.
