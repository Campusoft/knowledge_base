# Astro

Astro is an MPA framework. However, Astro is also unique from other MPA frameworks. Its main difference is that it uses JavaScript as its server language and runtime.

 In Astro, youâ€™re always just writing JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That way, you can render your UI components (like React and Svelte) on both the server and the client.
 
 The result is a developer experience that feels a lot like Next.js and other modern web frameworks, but with performance characteristics of a more traditional MPA site architecture.
