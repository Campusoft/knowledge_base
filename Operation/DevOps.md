# DevOps

Successful DevOps depends on cultural changeâ€”adopting a collaboration-first approach to software originally developed by open source teams. In open source, developers encourage transparency, shared workloads, continuous feedback and reviews, and robust documentation


- Improved productivity. Reduce manual tasks and gain consistency, reliability, and efficiency.
- Cloud-ready code. Easily provision environments in the cloud to help teams work faster at scale and meet demand.
- Security. Protect customers and code while managing access across locations and environments.
- Collaboration. Build and foster a collaborative culture with b communication.


history of DevOps 
DevOps sets a new standard for how we build software. Before the mid-2000s, developers, IT operations, and security teams typically worked in silos. Developers wrote code, QA teams tested it, and IT operations teams deployed it to production. Security teams checked code for vulnerabilities only after deployment. If someone reported an issue, the entire process started over again. This linear approach to software was slow and frustrating for everyone involved. Then in 2008, system administrator Patrick Debois and software developer Andrew Shafer created a working group to help bridge the gap between operations and development teams. Their best practices became the DevOps processes we know today

**Secrets management**
Secrets Management is the set of tools and techniques that grant confidentiality for your sensitive information, i.e., your secrets. In the application development context, typical secrets include application credentials, API keys, SSH keys, database passwords, encryption keys, and so on.

# Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)


# Jenkins 

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

# Gitlab 


GitLab is a single application with all the functionality of a DevSecOps Platform, allowing organizations to deliver software faster, while strengthening security and compliance, thereby maximizing the return on software development.


# Github



# DevSecOps 

DevSecOps focuses on security automation, testing and enforcement during DevOps - Release - SDLC cycles. The whole meaning behind this methodology is connecting together Development, Security and Operations. DevSecOps is methodology providing different methods, techniques and processes backed mainly with tooling focusing on developer / security experience.

DevSecOps takes care that security is part of every stage of DevOps loop - Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor.

This library contains list of tools and methodologies accompanied with resources. The main goal is to provide to the engineers a guide through opensource DevSecOps tooling. This repository covers only cyber security in the cloud and the DevSecOps scope.

90DaysOfDevOps

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will be starting this journey on the 1st January 2022 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be January 1st to March 31st.
