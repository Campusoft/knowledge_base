## Prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

Prometheus is a systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that many consider being the standard for Kubernetes monitoring -- and for a good reason. Prometheus has the ability to: 

- Collect time-series data by pulling through exporters
- Store data as queryable metrics
- Specify an arbitrary list of labels for multi-dimensionality
- Automatically discover new resources it should collect from 
- Easily build queries using time-series functions found in its native PromQL
- Generate and deliver threshold-based alerts through its Alertmanager
