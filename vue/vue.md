# directive

A directive is a special attribute that starts with the v- prefix

Attribute Bindings. 

```
<div v-bind:id="dynamicId"></div>
```

We can listen to DOM events using the v-on directive
```
<button v-on:click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```
v-on also has a shorthand
```
<button @click="increment">{{ count }}</button>
```

Form Bindings 
Using v-bind and v-on together, we can create two-way bindings on form input elements

To simplify two-way bindings, Vue provides a directive, v-model
```
<input v-model="text">
```

Conditional Rendering 
```
<h1 v-if="awesome">Vue is awesome!</h1>
```
