# Workspace

A workspace contains the files for one or more projects. A Workspace is a collection of Angular apps, projects, or libraries. Starting in Angular version 6 however, Angular introduced the concept of a workspace. 

 
# Multiple projects

A multi-project workspace is suitable for an enterprise that uses a single repository and global configuration for all Angular projects (the "monorepo" model). A multi-project workspace also supports library development.
 

***Monorepos***

A monorepo is a single git repository that holds the source code for multiple applications and libraries, along with the tooling for them.
