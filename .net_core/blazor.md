# Blazor
 

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. 

Blazor is a client-side web UI framework similar in nature to JavaScript front-end frameworks like Angular or React. Blazor handles user interactions and renders the necessary UI updates. Blazor isn't based on a request-reply model. User interactions are handled as events that aren't in the context of any particular HTTP request.


##Blazor app hosting models


- Client-side in the browser on WebAssembly.
- Server-side in an ASP.NET Core app.


##Bootstrap Blazor

- In the Blazor Server app, the root component's host page is defined in the _Host.cshtml file.

- In the Blazor WebAssembly app, the host page is a simple static HTML file under wwwroot/index.html. 


##UI components with Blazor

###Component parameters

###Event handlers

###Data binding

###Child content

###Code-behind


##Pages, routing, and layouts

##State management


##Forms and validation

Blazor supports the sharing of validation logic between both the client and the server. ASP.NET provides pre-built JavaScript implementations of many common server validations. In many cases, the developer still has to write JavaScript to fully implement their app-specific validation logic. The same model types, data annotations, and validation logic can be used on both the server and client.
