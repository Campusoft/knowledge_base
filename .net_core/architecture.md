Clean Architecture Solution Template: A starting point for Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 
- Now available as a project template within Visual Studio.
- The goal of this repository is to provide a basic solution structure that can be used to build Domain-Driven Design (DDD)-based or simply well-factored, SOLID applications using .NET Core
- Posee linea commandos. (Cli)
- Utiliza Autofac
- MediatR
- Domain Events (MediatR)
- Posee https://github.com/ardalis/Specification. Base class with tests for adding specifications to a DDD model. Also includes a default generic Repository base class with support for EF6 and EF Core
- No tiene UnitOfWork
https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture
 
 
This is a solution template for creating a Single Page App (SPA) with Angular and ASP.NET Core following the principles of Clean Architecture. Create a new project based on this template by clicking the above Use this template button or by installing and running the associated NuGet package (see Getting Started for full details).
- Posee linea commandos. (Cli)
- ASP.NET Core 6
- Entity Framework Core 6
- Angular 12
- MediatR
- AutoMapper
- FluentValidation
- NUnit, FluentAssertions, Moq & Respawn
- Docker 
- NSwag.AspNetCore. (Configurado en "HostAplicacion"/api)
- Domain Events (MediatR)
  - DbContext lanza  DispatchEvents. 
  - Las entidades deben implementar IHasDomainEvent para lanza eventos.
  - Lanza eventos por medio de un servicio DomainEventService : IDomainEventService. Esta implementacion utiliza MediatR
- Posee IPipelineBehavior, para colocar tuberias (pipe), en los flujos de MediatR. 
  - AuthorizationBehaviour. (Para autorizacion, con mediatR)

***CoolStore Web Application***


CoolStore Website is a containerised microservices application consisting of services based on .NET Core running on Dapr. It demonstrates how to wire up small microservices into a larger application using microservice architectural principals.
- All .NET microservices are developed by using NetCoreKit library.
- Dapr
- MediatR
- Scrutor - Assembly scanning and decoration extensions for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- React
- WebApiGateway. (YARP Reverse Proxy)

***clean-architecture-dotnet***

- DDD
- Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (a.k.a CQRS) (Use CQRSlite)
- MediatR - Simple, unambitious mediator implementation in .NET
- YARP - A toolkit for developing high-performance HTTP reverse proxy applications
- RestEase - Easy-to-use typesafe REST API client library for .NET Standard 1.1 and .NET Framework 4.5 and higher, which is simple and customisable
- Blazor - WASM - Client web apps with C#
- opentelemetry-dotnet - The OpenTelemetry .NET Client
- In medium and large software projects, we normally implement the CRUD actions over and over again. And it might take around 40-50% codebase just to do CRUD in the projects. The question is can we make standardized CRUD APIs, then we can use them in potential projects in the future?

FeedR

Sample (and rather simple) .NET6 microservices solution which acts as the data aggregator for the different feeds. The purpose of this solution is to explore the latest framework and play with different patterns, tools & libraries that can be useful when building distributed applications (but not only)
- Creado devmentors. (Existe videos)

"We came across the decision to orchestrate our microservices by using a "god" like service that controls the business logic or a choreographed approach where the microservices basically pass messages, In microservice architecture choreography is preferred over orchestration."

https://github.com/mjebrahimi/Awesome-Microservices-NetCore#sample-projects



There is a couple of microservices which implemented e-commerce modules over Catalog, Basket, Discount and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) and Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication and using Ocelot API Gateway.
