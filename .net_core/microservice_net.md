# Microservices with .net 

# Service-to-service communication

When constructing a cloud-native application, you'll want to be sensitive to how back-end services communicate with each other. Ideally, the less inter-service communication, the better. However, avoidance isn't always possible as back-end services often rely on one another to complete an operation.


***Service Aggregator Pattern***
Another option for eliminating microservice-to-microservice coupling is an Aggregator microservice

***service mesh***

A service mesh is a software layer that handles service-to-service communication

Right now, the main options for a service mesh in Kubernetes are linkerd and Istio.
