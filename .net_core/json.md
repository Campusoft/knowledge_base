# JsonSchema


NJsonSchema is a .NET library to read, generate and validate JSON Schema draft v4+ schemas. The library can read a schema from a file or string and validate JSON data against it. A schema can also be generated from an existing .NET class. With the code generation APIs you can generate C# and TypeScript classes or interfaces from a schema.
