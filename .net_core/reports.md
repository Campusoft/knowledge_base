Using objects

Simple values work well, but with complex entries it will start to get extremely complex. Scryber supports the standard object notations for properties arrays and dictionaries to help divide up the binding.

## QuestPDF

QuestPDF is an open-source .NET library for PDF documents generation.

It offers a layout engine designed with a full paging support in mind. The document consists of many simple elements (e.g. border, background, image, text, padding, table, grid etc.) that are composed together to create more complex structures. This way, as a developer, you can understand the behavior of every element and use them with full confidence. Additionally, the document and all its elements support paging functionality. For example, an element can be moved to the next page (if there is not enough space) or even be split between pages like table's rows.

Unlike other libraries, it does not rely on the HTML-to-PDF conversion which in many cases is not reliable. Instead, it implements its own layout engine that is optimized to cover all paging-related requirements.

QuestPDF Previewer

The QuestPDF Previewer is a tool designed to simplify and speed up your development lifecycle. First, it shows a preview of your document. But the real magic starts with the hot-reload capability! It observes your code and updates the preview every time you change the implementation. Get real-time results without the need of code recompilation. Save time and enjoy the task!
