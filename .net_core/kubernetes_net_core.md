The instructions are similar to using production certificates. The certificate generated by dotnet dev-certs is for use with localhost only and should not be used in an environment like Kubernetes. To support HTTPS within a Kubernetes cluster, use the tools provided by Manage TLS Certificates in a Cluster to setup TLS within pods

Avoiding downtime in rolling deployments by blocking SIGTERM
- Note that Kubernetes (and Linux in general) uses two different "shutdown" signals: SIGTERM and SIGKILL. There's lots of information on the differences, but the simple explanation is that SIGTERM is where the OS asks the process to stop. With SIGKILL it's not a question; the OS just kills the process. So SIGTERM gives a graceful shutdown, and SIGKILL is a hard stop.
