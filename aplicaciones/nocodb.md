# nocodb


NocoDB is a no-code database platform that allows teams to collaborate and build applications with ease of a familiar and intuitive spreadsheet interface. This allows even non-developers or business users to become software creators.

NocoDB works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface! This allows you to build no-code applications collaboratively with teams. NocoDB currently works with MySQL, PostgreSQL & SQLite (only in Open Source) databases.
