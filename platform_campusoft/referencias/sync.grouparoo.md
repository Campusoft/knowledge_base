# grouparoo
 
 
Grouparoo is an open source framework that helps you move data between your data warehouse and all of your cloud-based tools.

Reverse ETL, on the other hand, is the process that takes data from a data warehouse and sends that data to any number of different destinations or tools, finally letting you use your data warehouse for more than just analysis.

Reverse ETL allows you to sync records and groups across your tools

You already have the data you need in your warehouse, Reverse ETLs allow you to sync that tailored data to tools such as Salesforce, Zendesk, or Marketo where you can put it to use 


UI Editions

The Grouparoo User Interface (UI) is offered in two separate editions: @grouparoo/ui-community and @grouparoo/ui-enterprise.
