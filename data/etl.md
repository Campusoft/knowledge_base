# Singer

Simple, Composable, Open Source ETL

Singer powers data extraction and consolidation for all of your organization’s tools.

Singer describes how data extraction scripts—called “taps” —and data loading scripts—called “targets”— should communicate, allowing them to be used in any combination to move data from any source to any destination. Send data between databases, web APIs, files, queues, and just about anything else you can think of.
