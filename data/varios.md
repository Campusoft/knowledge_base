Kappa Architecture
The Kappa Architecture is a software architecture used for processing streaming data. The main premise behind the Kappa Architecture is that you can perform both real-time and batch processing, especially for analytics, with a single technology stack. It is based on a streaming architecture in which an incoming series of data is first stored in a messaging engine like Apache Kafka. From there, a stream processing engine will read the data and transform it into an analyzable format, and then store it into an analytics database for end users to query.
