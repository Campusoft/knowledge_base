# Apache Airflow

open-source orchestration and scheduling tool

With a focus on creating, monitoring, and managing workflows, Apacheâ€™s free and open-source Airflow platform is a go-to workflow management tool. Constituted of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), it helps users schedule, program, and automate the flow of data through nodes.

Airflow pipelines are defined in Python, allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.

Architecture Overview

Airflow is a workflow orchestration tool used for orchestrating distributed applications. It works by scheduling jobs across different servers or nodes using DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph). Apache Airflow provides a rich user interface that makes it easy to visualize the flow of data through the pipeline. You can also monitor the progress of each task and view logs.
