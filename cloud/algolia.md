Algolia is a hosted search API that provides online companies with the resources & tools they need to create fast, relevant search. 
 
Algolia will search through any set of data, as long as itâ€™s structured. This is what we call an index.

The items are broken down into individual records (objects), with each object containing a set of fields (attributes).
