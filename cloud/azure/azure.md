# Azure Kubernetes Service 



Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a free container service that simplifies the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes as a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestrator service.

Paying for only the virtual machines, and associated storage and networking resources consumed makes AKS the most efficient and cost-effective container service on the market.

***Build microservices on Azure***


Besides for the services themselves, some other components appear in a typical microservices architecture:

Management/orchestration. This component is responsible for placing services on nodes, identifying failures, rebalancing services across nodes, and so forth. Typically this component is an off-the-shelf technology such as Kubernetes, rather than something custom built.

API Gateway. The API gateway is the entry point for clients. Instead of calling services directly, clients call the API gateway, which forwards the call to the appropriate services on the back end.

Advantages of using an API gateway include:

-    It decouples clients from services. Services can be versioned or refactored without needing to update all of the clients.

-    Services can use messaging protocols that are not web friendly, such as AMQP.

-    The API Gateway can perform other cross-cutting functions such as authentication, logging, SSL termination, and load balancing.

-    Out-of-the-box policies, like for throttling, caching, transformation, or validation.
