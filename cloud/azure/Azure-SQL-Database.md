# Azure SQL Database and SQL Server

Azure â€” Difference between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server on VM

Backup
Azure SQL Database: It is automatic. It will support short-term (7 or 35 days) and Long-term up to 10 years based on the service tiers.
SQL Server on Azure VM: It is not an automatic process. The database backups are managed using SQL native or any third-party tools.

You can import a SQL Server database into Azure SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance using a BACPAC file. You can import the data from a BACPAC file stored in Azure Blob storage (standard storage only) or from local storage in an on-premises location. To maximize import speed by providing more and faster resources, scale your database to a higher service tier and compute size during the import process. You can then scale down after the import is successful.
