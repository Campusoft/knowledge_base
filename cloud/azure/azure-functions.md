# Azure Functions


Use your preferred language: Write functions in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, or use a custom handler to use virtually any other language.


# Azure Functions triggers and bindings concepts

Triggers are what cause a function to run. A trigger defines how a function is invoked and a function must have exactly one trigger. Triggers have associated data, which is often provided as the payload of the function.

Binding to a function is a way of declaratively connecting another resource to the function; bindings may be connected as input bindings, output bindings, or both. Data from bindings is provided to the function as parameters.

# Authentication / authorization

Azure Functions supports trigger, input, and output bindings for Azure Cosmos DB.

# Cosmos

This set of articles explains how to work with Azure Cosmos DB bindings in Azure Functions 2.x and higher. Azure Functions supports trigger, input, and output bindings for Azure Cosmos DB.
- Supported APIs. Azure Cosmos DB bindings are only supported for use with the SQL API. For all other Azure Cosmos DB APIs, you should access the database from your function by using the static client for your API, including Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB, Cassandra API, Gremlin API, and Table API.

Caching in Azure Function â€“ how you can use Redis

Azure Functions and Caching
You can use distributed cache, e.g. Redis, by using its SDK from Function code. Might be a bit nicer, since you keep the stateless nature of Functions, but might cost a bit more.
