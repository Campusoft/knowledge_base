# Analytic Views

24.1 What Are Analytic Views?

The Analytic Views feature is available with any Oracle Database 12.2 database installation, whether it be an Oracle Database Cloud Service, or an on-premise Oracle Database environment.


Analytic views provide a fast and efficient way to create analytic queries of data stored in existing database tables and views.

Analytic views organize data using a dimensional model. They allow you to easily add aggregations and calculations to data sets and to present data in views that can be queried with relatively simple SQL.
